# 1. game
I created a little pygame which you can play with your webcam and gesture recognition. The goal is to the dodge the falling rocks. You get more points dependent on the time till you collidate with a rock.  After that you can restart the game or quit it. The gesture reconition runs with the mediapipe libary.

# 2. game
In the second game I changed the game environment. Now you can control with your nose (or anything else of your body) a point in the playground. The goal of the game is to touch all red square with your nose as fast as possible until you reached the 10th hit. After that you recieve your time.

Also checkout the requirements text file so you have the same versions as I used.
